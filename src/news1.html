            A 15-member Indian judo team was forced to withdraw from the ongoing
            Asia-Oceania Olympic qualifiers in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan after two
            judokas -- Ajay Yadav and Ritu -- tested positive for COVID-19 just
            before the start of the tournament. Yadav, a 73kg class judoka, and
            Ritu (52kg) tested positive in the second test conducted after
            landing in Kyrgyzstan and both are asymptomatic. It became the first
            instance of an Indian contingent's campaign being derailed at an
            Olympic qualifier because of the dreaded virus. All the 15 judokas
            and four coaches had returned negative in the first test conducted
            after landing in the central Asian country. The entire 19-member
            contingent is currently in quarantine at a hotel in Bishkek. "After
            landing in Kyrgyzstan on April 4, there was a test done and all of
            us returned negative. But in the second test on April 5 just before
            the start of tournament, Ajay and Ritu returned positive," team
            coach Jiwan Sharma told PTI from Bishkek. "Ajay and Ritu are
            asymptomatic and they are self isolating at their respective rooms.
            They are in high spirits and we have been talking and giving
            encouragement to them through phone," he said. The Asia-Oceania
            Championships in Bishkek started on Tuesday and will end on
            Saturday. Under the tournament rules, if any player tests positive,
            the entire team will have to pull out. Prominent judokas in the team
            included Shushila Devi (women's 48kg), Jasleen Singh Saini (men's
            66kg), Tulika Mann (women's 78kg) and Avtar Singh (men's 100kg). All
            the four were in the race for one continental quota place. The
            Sports Authority of India (SAI), in a statement, said that both the
            judokas who tested positive for COVID-19 "don't have major symptoms
            and have been quarantined in a safe facility". "The judokas
            underwent four rounds of testing between March 30 and April 5 -- two
            before leaving (India) and one after landing in Bishkek and one a
            day before the competition. "It was during the fourth test before
            the competition that the two were found COVID positive," the SAI
            said. "The players are safe in a hotel with their daily requirements
            being looked after by the money allocated to them as daily allowance
            for the competition."

            The rest of the contingent is also in quarantine at the same hotel
            in Bishkek and the team management is seeking assistance from the
            Indian Embassy there. "We are talking to Sports Authority of India
            (SAI) as well as the Indian Embassy here. We are requesting that
            some members who tested negative be allowed to return home.
            Obviously, the two players will have to be looked after. "We will
            know in a day or two." The SAI said the sports ministry is in
            consultation with the Ministry of External Affairs to bring the
            players back home safely.

            Earlier, a source in the Judo Federation of India (JFI) blamed the
            JFI for the fiasco, stating that the federation jeopardised
            country's chances by allowing the entire contingent to travel
            together. "The entire squad, including four coaches, travelled
            together to Bishkek which could have been avoided. "Since the entire
            team travelled together and one player came out positive on arrival,
            it put paid to the hopes of others. This could have been avoided."
            Sharma said Indian judokas will have two more tournaments to try and
            qualify for the Olympics. Listen to the latest songs, only on
            JioSaavn.com "There is one Grand Prix event in Russia in May and
            then the World Championships in Hungary in June. We still have a
            chance," he said. "But we have only one quota place in all the
            weight categories, whoever accumulates maximum points will get the
            lone quota place."
