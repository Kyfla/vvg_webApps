          International Judo Federation Suspends Vladimir Putin As Honorary

            Russian president Vladimir Putin has been suspended as honorary
            president of the International Judo Federation (IJF) due to Russia's
            invasion of Ukraine, the sport's governing body announced on Sunday.
            The conflict has entered a fourth day with Moscow ordering its
            troops to advance in Ukraine "from all directions", while the West
            responded late Saturday with sanctions that sought to cripple
            Russia's banking sector. Ukrainian officials said 198 civilians,
            including three children, had been killed since Russia invaded early
            Thursday. "In light of the ongoing war... in Ukraine, the
            International Judo Federation announces the suspension of Mr.
            Vladimir Putin's status as Honorary President and Ambassador of the
            International Judo Federation," read the IJF statement.

            Putin, an accomplished judoka who was awarded an eighth dan in 2014
            -- one of the highest levels in the sport, has been honorary
            president since 2008. IJF president Marius Vizer lauded him back in
            2014 as "the perfect ambassador for our sport". Putin has made much
            of his fondness for keeping fit with judo and ice hockey. Putin's
            suspension comes on the back of a range of sporting punishments for
            Russia. European football's governing body UEFA stripped Saint
            Petersburg of the hosting of the May 28 Champions League final --
            their most prestigious club competition -- and Formula One cancelled
            the Russian Grand Prix scheduled for September 25. Listen to the
            latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com Both Poland and Sweden have said
            they will not play Russia in the 2022 World Cup play-offs with the
            Swedish Government, hoping to persuade their 27 European Union
            partners to implement a blanket sporting ban. This includes barring
            Russian athletes from competing on European Union soil.
